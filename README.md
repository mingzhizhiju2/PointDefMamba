PointDefMamba, a lightweight architecture centered on a content-adaptive Deformable Scanning (DS) mechanism. 
Point cloud analysis is fundamental to 3D perception, yet existing methods face significant limitations. Transformers suffer from prohibitive O(NÂ²) computational costs, while Mamba offers an efficient, linear-scaling (O(N)) alternative. However, applying state space models to unordered 3D dataintroduces challenges due to predefined scanning strategies disrupting geometric continuity. This study introduces PointDefMamba, a lightweight architecture featuring a content-adaptive deformable scanning mechanism. The model integrates a parameter-efficient deformation predictor with multi-scalespatial perception and a gated prediction head, achieving robust and efficient 3D analysis. Empirical validation shows PointDefMamba attains 92.9% accuracy on the ScanObjectNN benchmark and 92.0% on ModelNet40, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.
